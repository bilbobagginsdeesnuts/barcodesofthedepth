                Guten Targen, it is the month of october. I now realise i don't know if thats how you say good morning
                in german as i only learnt a term of it in year 7 at the very beginning and i was supposed to have
                learnt italian but the teacher got the wires crossed anyway i remember she also threatened to cut off
                someones rat tail and i cant remember the guys name but he did give off rat energy. I don't think it was
                simon wardell but that kid also gave off rat energy. I also remember in Japanese in term 3 or 4 we had
                to watch spirited away but with subtitles but he forgot to turn subtitles on so i now have an aversion
                to that movie as i don't know what the start is about and it was confusing and i vaguely remember the
                teacher thinking we were lying about the subtitles and refusing to check.
        </p>
        <p>
                Anyway. I also remember the time i got pulled into doing the magazine committee, we had one single
                meeting and got free binders. Then we never met again. High school was wild
        </p>
        <p>
                Anyway. Busy month. 2 weekends i was not in sydney which was fun but also driving is tiring and having
                to say goodbye at the end stinks but heres photos
        </p>

        <h1>Photos</h1>
        <p>
                Played dnd, got 2 d20’s and also failed a check so bad i took 4 mental damage out of my 7 hp
        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg"></p>

        <p>
                Drove to my mates place in bathurst for the long weekend, stopped off at the three sisters in the blue
                mountains and by george parking here was a cunt, i cannot beleive everyone also wanted to get out of
                sydney for the long weekend

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Perry is an adorable cat i was glad to get to befriend her- she just demanded pats
        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                It was my friends bday on sat night and we forgot to eat the TWO (2) freddos ice cream cakes that were
                purchased for the night so that was our lunch
        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image10.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Then on monday we had the grimace meal (its rough) before i left to drive home

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image26.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                The ride through the mountains has some spectacular views but also the traffic made me want to get out
                and go sicko mode - parts of the road are just 1 lane and its 70kmph but then they love to just give you
                an overtaking lane for a km and then its just a race to overtake the one slow car before suddenly theyre
                in front of you and you have to deal with them until you get to break free and then suddenly theres a
                crash so its 10 mins of stand still and im so glad to be free of it

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image18.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Saw my neighbours cat again and we got to have a staring contest again

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Fortnite put a chest in this hedge llamas ass and that made me laugh for too much

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image23.png"></p>
        <p>
                Then on a Friday night after a dinner i drove through the night to get to my grandfather's place, they
                replaced the maccas with a Hungry Jacks a while ago and the fact i cant get a hash brown at 11pm from
                there is bullshit, but the hot chocolate i got was near perfection for that time

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image12.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Then i got drunk with my mum and played pool, she pours heavy which is where i learnt to pur heavy from.
                Also the vodka in the background im drinking i found out was from my uncles first wedding and has been
                in my grandfathers bar for the past 25 years and honestly its pretty good vodka

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image16.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                She took this pic of me and fuck it im including it

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image13.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Went to South by south west sydney to see the opening night screening of Y2k which was a fun movie but i
                sincerely hated the entire vibe of south by, i spent 10 mins running around the icc trying to find the
                theatre thinking i was late but the movie started late because other people were also running around.
                The lobby of icc had just loose copies of forbes everywhere and i hated the vibe so much

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image11.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Saw titanique which is a 90 min retelling of titanic (a movie i realised i had only seen like once on
                free to air but only from when theyre on the boat to when he got handcuffed to something) by celen deon
                and it was gay and fantastic and hilarious and wild good shit.

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image21.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Aunty donna had their Grouse by Grouse House comedy night as apart of sxsw which was also fantastic,
                taking this sorta pic infront of those sorta walls is my new bit i guess - saw the mish and zach podcast
                be as off the rails as normal, Most Upsetting Guessing Game be just as deranged as normal and Demi
                Lardner’s so you wanna win a penis pump also being as crazy.

                Then finally i had a night where i wasnt doing something so i made muffins and pina coladas and watched
                merrily we roll along 10/10 would recommend but also making pina coladas is a huge pain the butt

        <p>
                Went home to get some more stuff and for some reason action man was sitting on the fence like this

        <p><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                The woolworths at waringah mall now has these ipads that you use to scan as you go and i felt crazy
                using it because it was only people under 30 using it and we all looked like ipad kids

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image17.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                I also painted my nails, i am ever so bad at it but its a fun vibe- ive re done it several more times
                since i took this pic and my adhd loves to have a little job to do that i can change at a whim

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Fornite has a thing where you just throw billy the puppets from saw? And also there are crt’s that have
                billy on it asking if you wanna play a game this shit is bonkers
        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image23.png"></p>
        <p>
                I finally got some spare keys cut because i for the last 2 months of living here have been absolutely
                terrified of locking myself out and also they fucked up one key and i had to get mitre 10 to cut it 3
                more times to get it right

        </p>
        <p><img alt="" src="images/image19.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                I also finally got an washing machine and i no longer have to lug my ass down to an laundromat and spend
                $18 on washing and then having to lug it home god it was depressing but now i feel all powerful

        <p><img alt="" src="images/image15.jpg"></p>
        <p>
                Then i spent frankly too much money to go to Luna Park alone to try and win a stupid contest (i didnt)
                and went on the ferris wheel solo (some of you have been on the ferris wheel with me and know just how
                much i fucking hated the experience of being on the ferris wheel especially alone without a
                counterbalance)

                                Theres an ep where gonzo drinks because his sad and they get hungover and its like, hey
                                tahts dope! Also its just so impressive the puppetry on display that i have to marvel at
                                it and go “this is so coooooool”</p>

                        <p><b>Flat Earthers: The Musical- </b> - Ok so. Im not a fan of Lou wall who is one of the three
                                writers of this (i found their micf show very sorta lazy? And reliant on just showing
                                memes and also had ai eh) and some of the bits at the start had me dreading the show but
                                as it went on it was less and less reliant on “isnt reddit wild” and it became much
                                stronger i think. Michelle brasier was the standout she ruled, also i didnt realise
                                until the after show q&a that the main character was also the main character of little
                                women and it properly shook me as they looked so different</p>

                        <p><b>Titanique </b> - This show has so many jokes packed into it that are all sold so well it
                                rules so much. Imagine if a bunch of gay 20 somethings were given the rights to tianique
                                and celen deons music and thats what this show is, parts are made up, parts are pure
                                chaos, but its sold so well that i had a fucking blast.

                        <p><b>Beetlejuice Beeltejuice </b> - So i havent seen beetlejuice. I grew up with my mum saying
                                it
                                was her favourite movie and that when it came out on vhs she ruined the tape by
                                rewinding when they said “beetlejuice beetlejuice beetlejuice”. But i have seen a
                                bootleg of the musical so i had a fucking blast with this, some scenes went on for too
                                long and sorta went no where but also it just felt like every part of the movie was made
                                with passion and love that i havent seen in a while, and also the weird burtonisms of
                                how everything looks fucked up rules. And there truly is a character that just exists
                                because tim burton thinks shes hot and thats fuckin dope. Also willem defo is just
                                turned up to 11 and sells it so well and is just such a great joke character

                <li>
                        <p><b>y2k </b> - This feels like one of kyle mooney’s snl sketches in the best way, so many just
                                good movie scenes but there are at least like 3 or 4 segments that could be sketches on
                                their own and the energy shifts so seamlessly i loved it. Also its not coming out till
                                december and so im the snob thats like "yeah i saw it early at a film festival"

                        <p><b>Haunted Mansion 2023 </b> - This movie focuses on how death sucks and also grief makes you
                                weak to ghosts i was so shocked that the disney movie was actually gonna go there with
                                it. It wasnt particularly good but i gotta admire the swings it took which also include
                                danny devito which is always a delight

                                Editors Note, Its Wolves. So i didnt get far in this because i watched it with my mum
                                after we played pool and we were both tipsy and sleepy but im not sure if the movie
                                holds up because it really feels like someone saw the money that the oceans trilogy made
                                and went “what if we did that” but then didnt seemingly realise that oceans had them as
                                great friends whereas wolves has them as enemies which is eh

                                style so seamlessly and is just such fun, The finale was on tonight and it was such a

                                just make a show about witches? theres a sprinkle of superhero shit but most of it is
                                dedicated to an story about witches told in a way that makes me think the writers have
                                an actual love for witchcraft and it didnt fuck up the ending! they kept saying in press
                                tours its gay
                                and like, come on no one is gonna believe that. but it honestly was sorta gay? in a like
                                "disney has to release this shit around the world so its gayness is subtle or only in
                                certain scenes" way

                                One of the penultimate episodes is a backdoor pilot to a show they never made and i
                                adore it so much because its such a swing to take that went no where but is like, youve
                                only got a 12 ep season for you to end and one is setting up a spin off that they didnt
                                do! The episode also had this bit that ruled. The final episode properly amde me cry not
                                only because its a beautiful send off and reflection to what death means but because i

                Its wild to be busy? Doing things most nights is fun but also fuck me it can be exhausting. But then
                again not doing things every night can be depressing. This is something to think about.

                today whilst on a work call and saw my nails and did almost cry because suddenly i realised thats what
                like self expression is and god gayyyyyy (sorry i had to i cannot be that sincere truly it isnt my
                brand. Get some drinks in me tho and i will be)

                October! What a month. On a programming note, next months email might be delayed by a day or two as i
                will be on an flight back from London that lands i think on the first? Oh actually there might not be a
                delay no actually im gonna say there might be one because i land at 6am and the qantas flight doesnt
                have wifi which is fun
